# In this file we define the options the player can pick.
# The most common types of options are Toggle, Range, and Choice.

# Options will be in the game's template yaml.
# They will be represented by checkboxes, sliders etc. on the game's options page on the website.
# NOTE: Options can also be made invisible from either of these places by overriding Option.visibility
# APQuest doesn't have an example of this, but this can be used for secret/hidden/advanced options.

# For further reading on options, you can also read the Options API Document

# The first type of Option we'll discuss is the Toggle.
# A toggle is an option that can either be on or off. This will be represented by a checkbox on the website.
# The default for a toggle is "off".
# If you want a toggle to be on by default, you can use the "DefaultOnToggle" class instead of teh "Toggle" class.
